      <pre>Javascript history:
        1. appear in 1995  with purpose was to handle some of the input validation that had previously been left to server-side languages 
        2. After that, No longer bound to simple data validation, JavaScript now interacts with nearly all aspects of the browser window and its contents.
        3. JavaScript has multiple verstion => it was decided that the language must be standardized.
            => a standard defining a new scripting language named ECMAScript
            => Since that time, browsers have tried, with varying degrees of success, to use ECMAScript as a basis for their JavaScript implementations.

        4. Though JavaScript and ECMAScript are often used synonymously, JavaScript is much more than just what is defined in ECMA-262. Indeed, 
           a complete JavaScript implementation is made up of the following three distinct parts:

           <ul>
             <li>The Core (ECMAScript)</li>
             <li>The Document Object Model (DOM)</li>
             <li>The Browser Object Model (BOM)</li>
           </ul>
        5. What exactly does ECMA-262 specify if it doesn't reference web browsers? On a very basic level, it describes the following parts of the language:

          Syntax
          Types
          Statements
          Keywords
          Reserved words
          Operators
          Global objects
          
          -------------
          - ECMAScript is simply a description of a language implementing all of the facets described in the specification. 
          - JavaScript implements ECMAScript
          - The sixth edition of ECMA-262:  referred to as ES6, ES2015: adds formal support for classes, modules, iterators, generators, arrow functions, promises, reflection, proxies, and a host of new data types.

        6. What Does ECMAScript Conformance Mean(Sự tuân thủ EcMascript có nghĩa là gì ?):
            ECMA-262 lays out the definition of ECMAScript conformance. To be considered an implementation of ECMAScript, an implementation must do the following:
              - Support all "types, values, objects, properties, functions, and program syntax and semantics” as they are described in ECMA-262.
              - Support the Unicode character standard.

           Additionally, a conforming implementation may do the following:
        
              - Add “additional types, values, objects, properties, and functions” that are not specified in ECMA-262. ECMA-262 describes these additions as primarily new objects or new properties of objects not given in the specification.
              - Support “program and regular expression syntax” that is not defined in ECMA-262 (meaning that the built-in regular-expression support is allowed to be altered and extended).
        
          => These criteria give implementation developers a great amount of power and flexibility for developing new languages based on ECMAScript, which partly accounts for its popularity.

        1. What is DOM ?
          -  The DOM maps out an entire page as a hierarchy of nodes
          -  By creating a tree to represent a document, the DOM allows developers an unprecedented level of control over its content and structure. Nodes can be removed, added, replaced, and modified easily by using the DOM API.
          - For web browsers, however, the DOM has been implemented using ECMAScript and now makes up a large part of the JavaScript language.

        2. Dom level: 
          - Whereas the goal of DOM Level 1 was to map out the structure of a document, the aims of DOM Level 2 were much broader. This extension of the original DOM added support for mouse and user-interface events (long supported by DHTML), ranges, and traversals (methods to iterate over a DOM document), and support for Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) through object interfaces. 
        
        3. Some module of DOM level 2:
          - DOM views:  Describes interfaces to keep track of the various views of a document 
          - DOM events: Describes interfaces for events and event handling
          - DOM style : Describes interfaces to deal with CSS-based styling of elements
          - DOM traversal and range: Describes interfaces to traverse and manipulate a document tree

        SUMMARY
        JavaScript is a scripting language designed to interact with web pages and is made up of the following three distinct parts:
        
        ECMAScript, which is defined in ECMA-262 and provides the core functionality
        The Document Object Model (DOM), which provides methods and interfaces for working with the content of a web page
        The Browser Object Model (BOM), which provides methods and interfaces for interacting with the browser
        There are varying levels of support for the three parts of JavaScript across the five major web browsers (Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Opera). Support for ECMAScript 5 is generally good across all browsers, and support for ECMAScript 6 and 7 is growing. Support for the DOM varies, but Level 3 compliance is increasingly normative. The BOM, codified in HTML5, can vary from browser to browser, though there are some commonalities that are assumed to be available.
